- This is an application that uses both Golang and NextJS 15
- `frontend/` is a NextJS 15 app with the following features:
  - Tailwind
  - Typescript
  - ESLint
  - App Router
  - Turbopack
  - Node 22 runtime for development
  - Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing
- We use Taskfile.yml for common tasks.  New tasks will be added to it to document and outline what new common tasks we can use.
- Use [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) to reference the project in more detail.
- Testing:
  - Frontend tests are in `frontend/app/__tests__` directory
