- This is an application that uses both Golang and NextJS 15
- `frontend/` is a NextJS 15 app with the following features:
  - Tailwind
  - Typescript
  - ESLint
  - App Router
  - Turbopack
  - Node 22 runtime for development
  - Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing
- `internal/db/` contains database related code:
  - `migrations/` directory stores SQL migration files
  - `migrate/` package handles database migration logic
  - SQLite database with golang-migrate for schema versioning
- We use Taskfile.yml for common tasks.  New tasks will be added to it to document and outline what new common tasks we can use.
- Use [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) to reference the project in more detail.
- Testing:
  - Frontend tests are typically located alongside components, often within `__tests__` subdirectories (e.g., `frontend/components/__tests__`).
  - Test files use `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` extension.
  - Run tests with `task frontend:test` or other test commands listed in `CLAUDE.md`.
  - See `frontend/TESTING.md` for detailed documentation (if available).
