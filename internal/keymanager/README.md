# Secret Management System Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the planned enhancements for the secret management system using Google's Tink library. The goal is to create a robust, secure, and user-friendly system for managing sensitive data.

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Testing (Completed)

- ‚úÖ Unit Tests
  - ‚úÖ Secret lifecycle (create, read, update, delete)
  - ‚úÖ Concurrent operations
  - ‚úÖ Error conditions
  - ‚úÖ Initialization and configuration
  - ‚úÖ File permissions and storage security

- ‚úÖ Integration Tests
  - ‚úÖ Persistence across manager restarts
  - ‚úÖ File system interactions
  - ‚úÖ Test with actual secrets and varying data sizes

- ‚úÖ Security Tests
  - ‚úÖ File permissions
  - ‚úÖ Key isolation
  - ‚úÖ Memory handling of sensitive data

### üöß Phase 2: Key Rotation Support (In Progress)

- ‚úÖ Requirements
  - ‚úÖ Manual key rotation trigger
  - ‚úÖ Version tracking for keys
  - ‚úÖ Graceful handling of existing secrets during rotation
  - ‚è≥ Automatic key rotation based on time/usage (Pending)

- ‚úÖ Implementation
  - ‚úÖ Key version tracking
  - ‚úÖ Key rotation logic
  - ‚úÖ Configuration for rotation policies
  - ‚è≥ Background job for automatic rotation (Pending)
  - ‚è≥ Metrics/logging for rotation events (Pending)

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Secret Versioning (Pending)

- Requirements
  - Track version history of secrets
  - Support retrieval of specific versions
  - Configure retention policy
  - Support rollback to previous versions

- Implementation Plan
  1. Enhance secret storage format to include versions
  2. Add version metadata tracking
  3. Implement version cleanup policy
  4. Add version-specific operations

### ‚è≥ Phase 4: Command Line Interface (Pending)

- Features
  - Initialize secret store
  - CRUD operations for secrets
  - Key rotation commands
  - Version management
  - Status and health checks
  - Backup and restore
  - Import/export functionality

### ‚è≥ Phase 5: Additional Features (Pending)

- Monitoring & Metrics
- Backup & Recovery
- Security Enhancements

## Current Implementation Details

### Key Rotation

- ‚úÖ Interface segregation into `SecretManager` and `KeyRotator`
- ‚úÖ Key version tracking with metadata
- ‚úÖ Secure re-encryption of existing secrets
- ‚úÖ Rotation policy configuration
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage including:
  - Basic rotation functionality
  - Multiple rotations
  - Error cases
  - Metadata persistence
  - Policy enforcement

### Security Features

- ‚úÖ Strict file permissions (0600 for secrets, 0700 for directories)
- ‚úÖ Permission validation on all operations
- ‚úÖ Secure key storage
- ‚úÖ Atomic operations for consistency
- ‚úÖ Proper cleanup and resource management

## Next Steps

1. Implement automatic key rotation based on policy
2. Add metrics and logging for rotation events
3. Begin implementation of secret versioning
4. Design and implement CLI interface

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ All tests passing with >80% coverage
- ‚úÖ Key rotation working reliably
- ‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities in implementation
- ‚è≥ Version management functioning correctly (Pending)
- ‚è≥ CLI tool providing full functionality (Pending)
- ‚è≥ Good performance under load (Pending)
- ‚è≥ Clear documentation and examples (In Progress)
